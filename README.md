## How It Works
The program takes a string representation of chords and transposes them by a given number of semitones. It can process a vector of strings representing multiple lines of tablature.

## Usage
To use the Chord Modulator, compile the provided C++ files in your development environment. Ensure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
